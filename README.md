Rainfall Prediction of Kannauj District using LSTM
Project Overview
This project predicts rainfall for the Kannauj district using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The model leverages a custom-collected dataset and employs advanced techniques such as 5-fold cross-validation and confusion matrix visualization for performance evaluation.

Dataset
Type: Custom-collected data.

Format: CSV file (rain_data.csv).

Features: Time-series data related to rainfall and potential influencing factors.

Preprocessing: Includes normalization/scaling and handling of missing values (if any).

Model
Algorithm: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network.

Architecture:

Input layer: Sequences of length sequence_length with multiple features.

Hidden layers:

LSTM layer with 64 units and sigmoid activation.

LSTM layer with 32 units and sigmoid activation.

LSTM layer with 16 units and sigmoid activation.

LSTM layer with 8 units and tanh activation.

Output layer: Dense layer with 1 unit for regression output.
